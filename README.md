## Overview

While looking at popular mod lists I noticed a few issues:

* Mod lists are built for extremely powerful computers or extremely low performance computers.
* Nearly all the major overhauls run their own Nexus mod pages with custom edits designed for their particular mod lists. This creates incompatibilities if you wish to add or change their lists.

The intention of S.I.B is to provide a Wabbajack list to build upon. Stripped down of mods that often conflict focusing mostly on bug fixes, meshes and textures.

### Included

* Mesh,Bug,Quest Fixes.
* User Interface Improvements.
* Mesh & Texture Replacers.
* Lighting and FX Replacers.
* New Animations.
* Performance Optimizations.
* Self Documented Mod Organizer.

### Purposefully Not Included

* Gameplay and Game System Changes.
* New Quests.
* New Items, Weapons, or Armour.
* Interrior or Exterior World Edits.
