#Title

Preamble: Give a quick overview about what your Modlist is about, the core idea and also mention that it's a Wabbajack Modlist (some might not know what Wabbajack is so link to this README)

Requirements: Simple list of requirements such as min CPU, GPU, RAM and most importantly: Drive Space. Also include a list of accounts the user needs such as a Nexus Mods, LoversLab, VectorPlexus Account or any other sites your are downloading from

Installation: Installation instructions specific to your Modlist. You can take a look at some of the Modlists linked below as almost all of them use the same instructions with minor changes

Important Mods you should know about: This is an important section you should not forget. Go in-depth on core mods and talk about important mods the user should know about. It can be overwhelming for the user to just be thrusted into a completely modded world without knowing what's even included and possible.

MCM: If your Modlist has some sort of MCM like for Skyrim or Fallout 4 then you should give instructions on what settings to use

Changelog: Should not be in the README and can be in a separate file called CHANGELOG.md but make sure to create one
