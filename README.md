# Somewhere In Between (S.I.B) 
A Skyrim Modding Automation.

## Overview

While looking at popular modlists I noticed a few issues:

* Modlists are built for extremely powerful computers or extremely low performance computers. 
* Nearly all the major overhauls run their own Nexus mod pages with custom edits designed for their particular modlists. 

This makes customization difficult for the amateur modder and lead me to building my own modlist. I followed a set a of rules for myself to avoid bugs, add content, and improve on the vanilla experience based on Reddit & Nexus community sentiment. This is based on my modding experiences over 10 years of Skyrim and general I.T professional knowledge.

The following are rules I followed while building this:

### Rules/Pros
* All mods must work together using patches available on the  Nexusmods site. No extenuating custom edits. Nothing an amateur couldn't do themselves by reading.
* All texture mods should be aware of middle grade graphics cards and systems. Textures right in front of your face should be 1-2k while everything else should look passable to play.
* I will read at least the first few pages worth of comments on each mod  page to determine compatibility and issues and general community sentiment. 
* I will teleport into cells affected by mods and test interactions where possible.
* I will stress test by setting movement speed high and traversing the world.
* I will be aware of the various types of systems in SkyrimSE and how they interact with each other. 
* I will build for the latest 1.6xxx edition binary only as this is the future.
* I will focus on the experience based on sentiment rather than number of mods, or comparison to the big mod lists.
* I will maintain appropriate documentation. 
* I will mark if it's safe to upgrade or starting a new save is required. 

### Cons:
* This will be an enhanced vanilla experience but mostly vanilla. 
* This will not be the kitchen sink and may have mods stripped out that are problematic.
* I do not have the time to do entire play through bug testing between versions.

## Requirements: 

Size Installed: 88 Gigabytes. This is in additomn to your 14GB SkyrimSE install.

My Specs: 
* Intel Core i7 3770 3.4ghz overlcoked to 4.2ghz (Ivy Bridge 22nm)
* Memory 800mhz DDR3 32GB
* Geforce 1060 6GB Edition (16nm). This is similar to a Geforce 1660.




Installation: Installation instructions specific to your Modlist. You can take a look at some of the Modlists linked below as almost all of them use the same instructions with minor changes

Important Mods you should know about: This is an important section you should not forget. Go in-depth on core mods and talk about important mods the user should know about. It can be overwhelming for the user to just be thrusted into a completely modded world without knowing what's even included and possible.

MCM: If your Modlist has some sort of MCM like for Skyrim or Fallout 4 then you should give instructions on what settings to use

Changelog: Should not be in the README and can be in a separate file called CHANGELOG.md but make sure to create one
