# Change Log

## 2022-02-01 0.1.0 Unreleased (Soon!)

Changing the scope of this project with what I've learned.  I'm going to offer a base and then offer documentation with recommendations and steps for patches. This achieves new goals that I have. 

1. A large amount of mods I would use with any playthrough. Why install from scratch when I pick the same few hundred mods every time? Why should you? Best options already worked out without advanced xedits inaccessible by most amateur modders. Still with the Geforce 1060 era in mind.
2. Keep compatibility patching to a minimum using auto FOMOD installers like patch packs. Only if absolutely necessary for things like lighting.
3. The user can learn about adding mods while remaining unimpeded by my base list. This list let's them quickly get down to business. Allows modding users to learn things through my documentation.
4. Offer documentation of mods that work well together and tips based on my own play throughs on keeping those mixes stable. (Foster Growth).
5. This is a starting point list and not intended to be updated by the user. Responsibility after initial install would be on the user to expand and update their files. If Wabbajack builds a way for me to provide updates without overwriting someones newly installed mods, then the scope will change. 
6. I'll keep it updated and make improvements as I learn and grow as well. 

## This will now be
